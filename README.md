- 👋 Hi, I’m @erikjackmueller, student at the Ilmenau University of Technology and guest researcher at the Max-Planck-Institute for Cognitive and Brain Science.
- 👀 I’m interested in bioelectromagnetics and superconducting electronics.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving sensitivity analysis of physical models for the python package pygpc and building a BEM simulation software for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in python as well as learning about the analysis of nonlinear dynamical models in julia.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on analysing nonlinear dynamical systems and modelling electromagnetic fields with neuroscience applications.
- 📫 How to reach me: erikjackmueller@gmail.com
